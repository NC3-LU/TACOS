                <h3>Information collection and use</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">This service <b>is not collecting any personally identifiable information</b>. The main goal is to allow the user to
                    <b>detect spam phone numbers</b>.
                    Incoming phone numbers from the smartphone are locally filtered, locally hashed (with the algorithm SHA-512), then
                    locally compared to already reported spam from our database.
                    For the filtering of the call logs the application requires the permission to read the call logs (android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG) of the device.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">If you choose to use our service, then you agree to the <b>manual collection</b> and use of information in
                    relation with this policy. The information that we collect (hashed value of phone number) will be used to improve this service.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">By manual collection it is important to understand that you will always decide which phone number you want
                    to report.</p>
